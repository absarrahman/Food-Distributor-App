# Food-Distributor-App
Call For Nation hackathon project. This app was designed for reducing food distribution issues during the crisis and for the contributing those who are working so hard donating and distributing food among the needy people.

First of all I really want to thank my teammates for cooperating with me. Without their support, it would be impossible for me to continue this project.

Thanks to @ZuhairHossain for designing the layouts.

May the Almighty save us from this crisis. Stay home, stay safe.
